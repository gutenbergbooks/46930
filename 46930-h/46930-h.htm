<p class="indent"><i>Mr. Wheeler.</i> &quot;<span class="smcap">I don&#39;t see what they want to build a great Wheel like that
for!</span>&quot;</p>

<h2>CRYSTALISED PALACE&#39;D FRUITS.</h2>

<p class="indent">Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span> heartily congratulates the Royal
Horticultural Society on their grand show
of British-grown fruit (none &quot;made in Germany&quot;),
and the Crystal Palace Company on
the excellent arrangements made for the
most advantageous display of these magnificent
<i>fruits defendus</i>,&mdash;for &quot;forbidden fruit&quot;
they certainly are, as, much to the disgust,
probably, of the apothecaries and family
doctors, the visitor may not taste any of the
luscious specimens attractively set before
him. They are all &quot;<i>les pommes du voisin</i>,&quot;
but though &quot;forbidden&quot; their appearance
was anything but &quot;forbidding.&quot; It came to
an end last Saturday, when it is reported
that all the fruits were safely got out of
the building except one sleepy pear, whom
nothing could arouse.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The Ingot and Outgot Silver Case.</span>&mdash;So
far the police are to be congratulated.
The detectives have acted with all the readiness
and decision of a <span class="smcap">Sherlock Holmes</span>.
Result so far is, that one <span class="smcap">Henry Bailey</span>&mdash;name
of not particularly happy omen in connection
with a certain Old Bailey&mdash;is in
custody, as also are four bars of silver.
<span class="smcap">Bailey</span> was taking four bars rest when
arrested and removed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;SCRAPS FROM CHAPS.&quot;&mdash;<span class="smcap">&quot;Corked&quot;
Stout.</span>&mdash;The Mitchelstown Guardians were
debating on the stout supplied to pauper
patients. A Mr. <span class="smcap">Dineen</span> proposed, &quot;That
in future the Treble X stout manufactured
by Messrs. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>, Cork, be used
in the workhouse instead of <span class="smcap">Guinness&#39;s</span>.&quot;
His argument was that &quot;it would help a
local manufacture,&quot; and that &quot;the doctors
all approved of <span class="smcap">Murphy&#39;s</span>.&quot; The chairman
suggested that they might &quot;be doing an
injustice to the patients by taking in
<span class="smcap">Murphy&#39;s</span> stout.&quot; Why not put the question
to the patients? It is <i>they</i> who will
have to &quot;take in <span class="smcap">Murphy&#39;s</span> stout,&quot; not the
guardians, and they are not likely to &quot;do
themselves the injustice&quot; of refusing it if
drinkable. <span class="smcap">Murphy&#39;s</span> stout is evidently a
light brew, as it was &quot;carried by one.&quot; Another
guardian described the resolution as a
&quot;blow which <span class="smcap">Guinness</span> didn&#39;t deserve&quot;;
but <span class="smcap">Guinness</span> survived the blow, and went up
ten points on the Stock Exchange next day.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A New Morality.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
[&quot;The working woman of to-day, be she journalist,
teacher, or what not, is suffering terribly from
fierce competition, and this is largely due to the
fact that women who are merely working for
pleasure enter the labour market.&quot;&mdash;<i>&quot;An Old-Fashioned
Woman&quot; in the &quot;Daily Chronicle.&quot;</i>]</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>When the Curse of Labour was laid on Man,</p>
<p class="i2">Toil&#39;s visage glowered grimly,</p>
<p>Alleviations of Fate&#39;s stern plan,</p>
<p>The softening spirits in rear and van</p>
<p>Of Labour&#39;s march through our Life&#39;s brief span,</p>
<p class="i2">If seen, were glimpsed but dimly.</p>
<p>Weariness followed, and dulness gloomed,</p>
<p>On the path of mortals to hunger doomed,</p>
<p>And poverty the spirit entombed</p>
<p class="i2">As in all too premature charnel;</p>
<p>The ache of limb and the fret of brain,</p>
<p>The slow weak pulse, and the long dull pain,</p>
<p>Grew all familiar; the spirit-strain,</p>
<p>And the sullen revolt again and again,</p>
<p class="i2">Of the spiritual and carnal.</p>
<p>But though men knew that work and woe</p>
<p class="i2">Were all too closely neighbour;</p>
<p>One curse of Labour they did <i>not</i> know;</p>
<p>The black blight coming late and slow,</p>
<p class="i2">Of the fools who <i>play</i> at Labour!</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Labour! Faith,&#39;tis no passing play</p>
<p>But the pack-horse burden day after day</p>
<p class="i2">To be grimly gravely lifted.</p>
<p>A leaden weight, and a mill-wheel round,</p>
<p>By the player at labour but seldom found,</p>
<p class="i2">Or the amateur&mdash;though gifted.</p>
<p>Who has not seen a street-child run</p>
<p>To turn an organ-handle&mdash;for fun&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">With gay, erratic vigour?</p>
<p>But the grinder who turns at it day by day</p>
<p>Finds <i>Ah che la morte</i> no pleasant play,&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2"><i>He</i> works at it&mdash;-&quot;like a nigger.&quot;</p>
<p>So &quot;well-to-do women who crowd the ranks&quot;</p>
<p>Of Labour are playing but childish pranks;</p>
<p class="i2">They are butterfly despoilers</p>
<p>Of the honeyed hives of the working bees;</p>
<p>They lower the wage and lessen the ease</p>
<p class="i2">Of the true fate-destined toilers.<a name="FNanchor_A_A" id="FNanchor_A_A"></a>

<p>To teach for pin-money possibly&#39;s fun</p>
<p>To those who&#39;re but dabblers when all is done,</p>
<p>But the workers, when wages go down with a run,</p>
<p class="i2">Can hardly see the sport of it.</p>
<p>To play at philanthropy&#39;s mischievous, much,</p>
<p>For sciolists mar whatsoever they touch;</p>
<p class="i2">What if some Flower Girl Mission</p>
<p>Destroy a trade, which seeks other lands,</p>
<p>Or throw out of work some thousands of hands?</p>
<p class="i2">Philanthropy hath no vision</p>
<p>Save of its pretty and picturesque fad;</p>
<p>And the destitute drudges, angry and sad,</p>
<p>Whom deft flower-mounting once fed and clad</p>
<p class="i2">Shall find redress a rarity.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t play at Reform, it you love your neighbour!</p>
<p>But well-to-do women, your &quot;playing at Labour&quot;</p>
<p class="i2">Works worse than playing at Charity!</p>
<p>Work? Well doubtless &#39;tis pleasant and &quot;funny&quot;</p>
<p>For well,&mdash;&quot;just a little pocket-money,&quot;</p>
<p>To ape the bees who <i>must</i> make the honey</p>
<p class="i2">Day in, day out, for a living.</p>
<p>But workers who labour for &quot;bread and cheese,&quot;</p>
<p>And not as a change from mere lady-like ease,</p>
<p>Regard all such amateur, sham, busy-bees</p>
<p class="i2">As needing, not praise, but forgiving.</p>
<p>What if your work-dabbling, now quite the rage,</p>
<p>Cut down the genuine workwoman&#39;s wage,</p>
<p class="i2">Or pinch the poor ill-paid school teacher?</p>
<p>&quot;Every woman should work all she&#39;s able&quot;?</p>
<p>Maybe you need a new species of fable,</p>
<p class="i2">A sager than copy-book preacher.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ant and the Grasshopper&quot;? There lurketh Cant!</p>
<p>If Grasshopper labour-spurts starve the poor Ant.</p>
<p>If well-to-do woman work helps to spread want,</p>
<p class="i2">This new-born blind zeal sense should bridle.</p>
<p>There&#39;s fit work for all, some with spade, some with tabor;</p>
<p>But Madam, if feminine &quot;playing at Labour,&quot;</p>
<p>Whilst needless to you, wrecks one workwoman neighbour,</p>

<h2>LETTERS FROM A FIANCEE.</h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Dear Marjorie</span>,&mdash;Thanks for your kind letter. I was hoping you
would be pleased about my engagement.</p>

<p class="indent">It is most curious you should have guessed, without my telling you,
and without even seeing his photograph, that his name is <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>.
I must tell you more about him. He is tall and handsome, also, <i>not
at all commonplace</i>. He looks a little like the old prints one sees in
seaside lodging-houses, called &quot;<i>With the Stream</i>,&quot; or &quot;<i>Against the
Stream</i>,&quot; or &quot;<i>Good-bye</i>,&quot; or &quot;<i>The Return of the Black Brunswicker</i>.&quot;
He looks, in fact, far more romantic than the young men
one generally sees: and the key-note (if you will forgive the expression)
of his character is his great dislike to modern ideas,
especially to anything he calls &quot;cynical.&quot; I met him first at Lady
<span class="smcap">Lyon Taymer&#39;s</span>, but he has often explained to me that that was
entirely accidental; he was &quot;taken&quot; there; he dislikes her set, and
has an especial aversion to the clever young men of the day. He
has an excessive&mdash;and I must say I think unnecessary&mdash;terror of
being mistaken for one: and says that if he had not heard it was the
very latest thing he would never read anything but <span class="smcap">Scott</span>. To the
bicycle and cigarette, for women, he has an equally strong objection,
and I think he often pretends not to see a joke because he has a
nervous suspicion of its being what <i>he</i> would call the New Humour.
In the evening, on the balcony, he quotes <span class="smcap">Byron</span>, and in the
morning, in the garden, he reads <span class="smcap">Wilkie Collins</span> or Mrs. <span class="smcap">Henry
Wood</span>. He says he hopes I shall spend a great deal of time in the
still-room, to which I heartily assent, though neither of us know
exactly what a still-room is, but it sounds quiet. Women, <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>
thinks, should preserve fruits, and a lady-like demeanour, and
do plain needle-work, or perhaps &quot;tatting.&quot; Art embroidery
he looks on with doubt, and I believe he considers it <i>fast</i>. When
I told him he seemed anxious I should not <i>reap</i> without having
learnt to <i>sew</i>, he seemed hurt and we hastily changed the subject.
I was playing croquet with him&mdash;(croquet he approves)&mdash;when
he was lecturing on fruit-preserving. &quot;Shall you really
expect me to make jam?&quot; I said. &quot;Would you be cross if
I did?&quot; he asked, tenderly. &quot;<span class="smcap">Crosse!</span> yes! and <span class="smcap">Blackwell</span>,
too, if you like,&quot; I answered in my (occasionally) flippant way,
which I always regret instantly after. <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> threw down his
mallet. &quot;This&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gladys</span>&mdash;this is the sort of thing which&mdash;which&mdash;,&quot;
&amp;c. We had a short quarrel, and a long reconciliation. <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> is
a <i>great dear</i>, you must understand, and I am very happy. He does
not show me the book of dried flowers nearly so often now, and
has written some verses about me, he is going to show them to
me to-night.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Arthur</span> is very interesting when he talks of <i>me</i>; it is when he
discusses abstract subjects&mdash;such as chemistry, or big sleeves&mdash;that
he is not quite so amusing. He <i>is</i> dreadfully prejudiced about
sleeves. Do you think he will gradually get accustomed to them? I
think he will by the time they have quite gone out!</p>

<p class="indent">I am sure you will like dear <span class="smcap">Arthur</span>. Of course one has to
understand him. When he came down to stay with us, I said, &quot;You
must be very tired after your short journey,&quot; and I was surprised
how much it annoyed him! Don&#39;t say anything of that sort to
him&mdash;<i>at first</i>. He is apt to take things&mdash;just a little&mdash;seriously. It
is rather a charming quality in a man to whom one is engaged&mdash;don&#39;t
you think so? Such a love as ours cannot fail to have an
ennobling effect: as <span class="smcap">Arthur</span> says, it seems to lift us above all
thoughts of this world. Write soon. I am longing to hear about
the new skirts, and to show you my sapphire ring.</p>

<p class="indent">The gammon of <span class="smcap">Bacon</span> was admirable; and his strict attention to
the duties of servants towards visitors to
the hotel was &quot;aside of <span class="smcap">Bacon</span>&quot; not to be
forgotten. A. B. was an ideal landlord,
ever ready at his door to welcome the
coming and speed the parting guest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Grand&quot; at Cromer is not an
enormous hotel: it is a Semi-Grand.
The example of <span class="smcap">Bacon</span> aforesaid could be
therefore easily imitated. Warned of our
arrival by letter, rooms secured, train
punctual (from St. Pancras to Cromer) to
within ten minutes, we drove up to the
door of the Semi-Grand in our one-horse
fly. Not a soul about. Surely the hotel
is open? Yes, the driver knew that
much, &quot;because he had taken some
people away from there in the morning.&quot;
These might have been the last roses of summer, the last visitors at
the hotel for the season! We waited; no signs of life. &quot;Should
he (the driver) ring?&quot; Certainly: a most happy thought. He descendeth;
he ringeth. We wait. Then the sound as of a somebody
coming. &quot;A Boots in sight appears. We hail him with three cheers&quot;&mdash;at
least, we ask &quot;if our rooms are ready,&quot; and the Boots is of
opinion that they are; whereupon another Boots appears, and the
pair of Boots lug our luggage into the hall, where we find an
amiable lady with keys in her hand who invites us to inspect certain
apartments. Our answer is an adaptation of <i>Hamlet&#39;s</i> command to
the <i>Ghost</i>, &quot;Lead on, we follow.&quot;</p>

<p class="center">* * *</p>

<p class="indent">We see: we refuse. These are <i>not</i> the rooms we had ordered.
&quot;No, they are not.&quot; So much is admitted. Then, perhaps, we had
better depart and seek hospitality elsewhere. Our beckoner would
rather not put us to such inconvenience, and soon discovers what
will suit us exactly. So we take them then and there. They <i>do</i>
suit us exactly: not down to the ground, as they are first floor. A
room with balcony, in the shade all day, facing north, commanding a
lovely sea view. What more could mortal require?</p>

<p class="center">* * *</p>

<p class="indent">The air of Cromer, where there is &quot;nothing between you and the
North Pole&quot;&mdash;so any malicious reports to the contrary may be
safely disregarded&mdash;is most exhilarating. But the dust O! The
dust! On with the water-carts, and down with sandy dust! It is
all sand&mdash;everywhere. As to situation the Semi-Grand has a decided,
and sea-sided, advantage over the other hotels.</p>

<p class="center">* * *</p>

<p class="indent">Delightful view from front windows of the Semi-Grand. Of
course the back rooms are rather behind in this respect. Which is
but natural.</p>

<p class="center">* * *</p>

<p class="indent">Civility, and a desire to please, are the characteristics of the working
staff at the Semi-Grand, directly you know them individually and
collectively. But, as the song says, &quot;You&#39;ve got to know &#39;em <i>fust</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="center">* * *</p>

<p class="indent">With the arrangements of the <i>salle à manger</i> as worked at the Semi-Grand
under the superintendence of a distinguished and invaluable
foreigner <i>garçon en chef</i>, very little fault can be found. The
experiments of the youthful and less-experienced subordinates who
are probably there to learn English, are interesting from a certain
point of view, which is attained when, under the guardianship of
their chief, or one of his trusty lieutenants, you have had everything
you require. <i>Then</i> you can sit and watch the recruits at their
<i>garçonic</i> exercises.</p>

<p class="center">* * *</p>

<p class="indent">I wonder if the <i>Generalissimo</i> has them out for drill every morning
before visitors are up? Are there any colleges, or barracks, for
waiters, where, as undergraduates, or recruits, they can learn their
business? From what I have seen I should say most probably not.
But there ought to be schools and colleges for waiters, with degrees
conferred and diplomas given. Switzerland would be the place wherein
to start this idea.</p>

<p class="center">* * *</p>

<p class="indent">Were it not for the refreshing breezes, which rival and excel
those of Margate, the Cromerites would be burnt to cinders. As it
is, they are generally a delicate improvement on the colour of their
own lobsters when boiled. &quot;To this complexion must you come at
last&quot;&mdash;if you stay long enough at Cromer.</p>

<h3>Did Napoleon ever try to land
at Cromer, and lose his <i>celebrated
cocked</i> hat in the attempt?</h3>
</div>

<p class="indent"><i>A Curiosity at Cromer.</i>&mdash;Exactly in front of where I am now
seated, enjoying the Cromeric morning breezes on the very edge of
the cliff, and at a distance of about twenty-five yards from the
Cromer Sands, there rises a remarkable wooden effigy, on the true
import of which I positively refuse to be enlightened by any native
offering me a mere matter-of-fact explanation.</p>

<p class="center">* * *</p>

<p class="indent">The object, which I sketch on the spot, in order that an experienced
hand shall give it artistic merit,
appears to be the gigantic wooden case
&quot;made and provided&quot; for equally
gigantic cocked hat, originally worn by
a Titanic Admiral, long since laid up
in sea-weed, with all the rest of his
uniform, in the locker of Mr. Davy
Jones, Neptune&#39;s wardrobe keeper.
This huge object is stuck on a pole,
either as marking the last resting-place,
there or thereabouts, of colossal
Admiral aforesaid, or it has been for
ages left here as indicating the fate
certain to await the ruthless and recklessly
wrecked invader. It may mark
the spot where quietly, one dark night,
the Great <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> rehearsed, <i>all by
himself</i>, the invasion of England; being
only too glad to escape in the
early dawn, leaving his cocked hat
behind him, which, as a Napoleonic
relic, was inclosed in a wooden case of
three times its size, and here exposed, with the motto in best
Cromeric French, addressed to <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, should he ever have
attempted to repeat his visit:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
&quot;<i>Voici votre chapeau à cornes! Venez le prendre!</i>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The inscription is, by flux of time and sea-water, almost, if not
quite, illegible.</p>

<p class="center">* * *</p>

<p class="indent">Or it may mark the spot, banned and anathematised, where was
buried, according to the awfully solemn Masonic ritual, <i>the mangled
remains of The Man who couldn&#39;t keep a secret!!</i></p>

<h2>ANGLING EXTRAORDINARY.</h2>

<p class="indent">From <i>The Scotsman</i>, Saturday, September 21, under the heading

fishing notes from &quot;Loch Earn&quot; and &quot;Dhu Loch&quot;:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Annan.</span>&mdash;There were large supplies of all classes of stock. Best beef made
7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 7<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> per stone, and mutton 7<i>d.</i> to 7-1/2<i>d.</i> per lb. There was a
crowded attendance of buyers from England and the South of Scotland, and
the demand was good all through. Store cattle had a slow trade, and were
bad to sell. Quotations:&mdash;Fat bullocks up to £15 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; do. heifers up to
£15 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; do. cows up to £13 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; calving heifers £12 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The Putney Spook.</span>&mdash;Within the last week, so reported one of the
Day-by-Days in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, a ghost has been heard of at
Putney. Hundreds of <i>Hamlets</i>, <i>Marcelluses</i>, and <i>Barnardos</i> (with
<i>Ophelias</i>, and other ladies) have gone out of their way nightly to
see the ghost. What should a riverside ghost be like? Obviously
the &quot;main-sheet&quot; from a sailing-boat is ready to hand, and for its
head, at any neighbouring boat-house, there is quite a choice of
&quot;sculls.&quot; If any hair, there are the &quot;row-locks.&quot; The ghost
must not, in our opinion, be expected anywhere with or against the
stream, but in some &quot;dead-water.&quot; &quot;Will the ghost walk
to-night?&quot; is now the Shakspearian inquiry; to which the reply is,
&quot;Go to Putney!&quot;</p>

<h3>Master Romeo probably seventeen, and
Miss Juliet certainly fourteen years old.</h3>
</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap"><i>Juliet</i></span> is, according to her nurse, just fourteen years of age.
The story is that of &quot;<i>Villikins
and his Dinah&quot;:</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>There was a rich noble in Verona did dwell,</p>
<p>He had but one daughter an unkimmun fine young gal,</p>
<p>Her name it was <i>Juliet</i>, just fourteen years old,</p>
<p>With a werry large fortune in siliver and gold.</p>
<p class="i4">Singing tooral li (<i>ad. lib.</i>).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The southern girl of fourteen
equals the northerner of
nineteen; and this must ever
be the initial difficulty which
few experienced actresses, can
surmount. <i>Juliet</i> is, in fact,
a single girl and a married
young woman rolled into one.
&quot;Single,&quot; &quot;double,&quot; and
&quot;there&#39;s the rub!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pat Campbell&#39;s</span> <i>Juliet</i>
takes the poison, but not the
cake. Her <i>Juliet</i> has over her
the shadow of <i>Paula Tanqueray</i>.
From the commencement, except in the Balcony scene, she is
a <i>Juliet</i> &quot;with a past.&quot; The balcony and the moonlight suit this
<i>Juliet</i>. Good, too, is she when, abjectly miserable, she crumples
herself up all in a heap, like the victim in a picture of Japanese
torture, so that at any moment, without surprising the spectator,
she might turn heels over head and straighten herself out at the
feet of the irascible old <i>Capulet</i>. Once again let me adapt a verse
of the ancient ditty:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&quot;Oh Papa, oh Papa, I&#39;ve not made up my mind,</p>
<p>And to marry just yet I do <i>not</i> feel inclined.&quot;</p>
<p>(<i>Aside.</i>) To <i>Laurence</i> the Friar I&#39;ll tell all my grief,</p>
<p>And the reverend gent may afford me relief</p>
<p class="i4">By singing (<i>as a duett</i>) tooral li tooral, &amp;c.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Judging from the <i>Tanqueray</i> model, Mrs. <span class="smcap">Pat Campbell</span> <i>ought</i> to
have been at her best in the potion scene; but, she wasn&#39;t. As for
the final stabbing, she might as well have tickled herself with a
straw and died o&#39; laughing.</p>

<h3>Romeo Robertson ready for any
undertaking. Vaults opened, &amp;c.</h3>
</div>

<p class="indent">Watching <span class="smcap">Forbes-Robertson</span> as <i>Romeo</i>, I could not help thinking
what an excellent <i>Hamlet</i> he would make; perhaps when I see
him in that character, I shall
remember how good he was as
<i>Romeo</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&quot;<i>Hamlet Romeo amem, rentosus Romeo Hamlet.</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But that&#39;s another story; so suffice
it that temporarily <span class="smcap">Forbes-Robertson</span>
is &quot;Our Only <i>Romeo</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Rev. <span class="smcap">Nutcombe Gould</span>, as
<i>Friar Laurence</i>, gives quite a new
reading of the part. His <i>Friar</i> has
ever a merry little twinkle in his
eye, as if quietly enjoying some intensely
humourous idea. From this
point of view, Mr. <span class="smcap">Nutcombe
Gould&#39;s</span> <i>Friar</i>, being a sort of Rev.
<span class="smcap">Theodore Hook</span>, ever ready with
a practical joke and an impromptu,
is admirable and&mdash;inimitable.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mercutio&#39;s</i> part is &quot;full of
plums&quot;; but these, in Mr. <span class="smcap">Coghlan&#39;s</span>
mouth, seemed rather to mar
the distinctness of his utterance,
as plums in a mouth have a way of
doing. The <i>Apothecary</i>, by Brother
<span class="smcap">Robertson</span>, was not so poor as he
looked: but in spite of tradition as
to the wondrous excellence of this &quot;bit of character,&quot; what is there
to be done with it except in a three minutes acting illustration of an
artistic &quot;make up&quot;? Were I offered the part I should bargain
(after settling of course to receive a thousand a week) for a scene so
arranged as to show the exterior and the interior of the shop. I
would be &quot;on&quot; from the first, visibly sleeping under the counter.
The interior should be fitted up with shelves just as <i>Romeo</i> describes
it. Then while <i>Romeo</i> is talking, my <i>Apothecary</i> would be examining
his &quot;till&quot;; he would turn it upside down to show there was no
cash; he would then in pantomime explain how famished he feels,
and would search, even in an old mouse-trap, for a bit of cheese.
At last, there being no dinner and no hope of food, he, after a
pantomimic exhibition of frenzied despair, would be in the act of
drinking from a large bottle, labelled &quot;<i>Poison,&mdash;for external application
only</i>,&quot; when he hears <i>Romeo</i> calling him. Then he starts:
while there is life there is hope! he answers the summons! And so
forth. Then imagine the <i>Apothecary with the money</i> after <i>Romeo&#39;s</i>
departure!! As the scene is closing the <i>Apothecary</i> should be seen
bucking himself up, and preparing to go out to make a night of it
at the nearest restaurant. Should Mr. <span class="smcap">Forbes-Robertson</span> be
making any alterations he is welcome to these suggestions.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;In &quot;the dead season,&quot; when despairing editors, or their

acted upon by those whom Providence has afflicted with the

London, Chatham, and Dover</i>.&quot; As a much-travelled Ulysses,
experienced in &quot;lines cast in pleasant&quot; and unpleasant &quot;places,&quot;

L. C. &amp; D.&#39;s &quot;Granville Express&quot; is, as far as my experience
goes, which is co-extensive with the whole length of the line, up

which this Ulysses happens to be acquainted. When &quot;S. T. H.&quot;
attests that &quot;<i>for courtesy and attention to the oft-times exacting
demands of passengers the company&#39;s staff will compare not unfavourably
with those of the Northern railways</i>,&quot; I beg &quot;to say
ditto&quot;; with the proviso, that, personally, I am, in a general way,
of Mrs. <span class="smcap">Malaprop&#39;s</span> opinion, that &quot;caparisons are odorous.&quot; Sir,

</div>

<p class="indent">The Baron has dipped into a refreshingly light and airy volume
called <i>The Impressions of Aureole</i>, published by <span class="smcap">Chatto and Windus</span>.
Just the volume for the tourist resting awhile from his London-seasonable
labours. <i>Aureole</i> does a little bit of everything and
enjoys it all. She has the faculty of
appreciation for scenes in town and country,
at home and abroad. She &quot;sails away in
a galliant ship&quot; like <i>Roy Neil&#39;s</i> bride into
Icebergian regions, where &quot;<i>we pray under
our breaths for illuminating sunshine and
the ice bink is given us in half-miraculous
substitution</i>.&quot; &quot;Half-miraculous&quot; is good.
Half a miracle better than no miracle at
all.</p>

<p class="indent">Then on another occasion writes
<i>Aureole</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
&quot;We find our way into a gleamy wood, and I
gather some crimson berries, oozing from a cool
green bank like drops of blood, while unfamiliar blossoms flourish in gay
clusters at my feet.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;Personally,&quot; says the Baron, speaking for himself, &quot;should not
like to gather &#39;drops of blood.&#39;&quot; Glad that the blossoms were so
well behaved as not to be familiar.</p>

<p class="indent">How delightful to be on board with our enthusiastic <i>Aureole</i>, and,
if she will only trust one with it, enjoy for a few moments the loan
of her &quot;<i>ivory lorgnette</i>&quot; with &quot;<i>diamond initials</i>&quot; which &quot;<i>seem to
gleam responsively when</i>,&quot; says <i>Aureole</i>, &quot;<i>I sweep the horizon
with ecstacy</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Aureole</i>, the gadabout and globetrotter, is delightful everywhere.
The one touch of domestic nature does come in now and again, and
her &quot;dear <span class="smcap">Bill</span>,&quot; her &quot;handsome <span class="smcap">Bill</span>,&quot; her rackety, good-half <span class="smcap">Bill</span>,
on being reminded by <i>Aureole</i> that they have to dine at the Savoy 7.30,
exclaims &quot;Confound these blessed bothering <i>cafés</i>. This is five
nights running. Can&#39;t we chuck the thing?&quot; Then <i>Aureole</i> asks
him &quot;What on earth do you want?&quot; &quot;&#39;Want!&#39; why a mutton chop,
and a wife, and a whisky-and-soda,&quot; says <span class="smcap">Bill</span>, brutally. And then
they go to the &quot;palace of luxury&quot; and &quot;dine with seven other
spirits more weary than ourselves.&quot; So they might all dirge in
chorus the old duet of &quot;<i>Again we come to thee, Savoy!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Masked Ball story is very well told&mdash;quite a little comedy;
and of course all the gay resorts at home and abroad are visited
by the lively <i>Aureole</i>. &#39;Tis a sketch of &quot;How we live now,&quot; and
must please a number of people who are &quot;in the movement,&quot; and
a great many more who are out of it, but who like to be up in what
is going on, and to imagine that they also could be of the gay world
if only they chose. Fill me a bumper of cold (not iced) champagne,
which, to <i>Aureole</i>, quaffs</p>

<p class="author">The appreciative <span class="smcap">Baron de Book-Worms</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">P.S. To those among his reading-friends who appreciate the clever
and amusing work of &quot;<span class="smcap">Gyp</span>,&quot; the Baron strongly recommends <i>Le
C&oelig;ur d&#39;Ariane</i>. No necessity to send to &quot;Rue Auber&quot; for it:
<i>allez le chercher chez</i> <span class="smcap">M. Roques</span>, 64, New Bond Street, and see that
you get it. The Baron wishes you <i>may</i> get it, as you are certain to
enjoy the book immensely. Be prepared to be thoroughly <i>enjôlé</i> by

<h2>ROEHAMPTON GATE AND THE L. C. C.</h2>

<p class="indent">The public, represented by the First Commissioner of Works

we remember aright, a provokingly private road, leading, as a
short cut, from Wandsworth Common up to &quot;Roehampton Gate,&quot;
which is a closed entrance to Richmond Park) what <i>Sam Weller</i>
might have correctly described as a &quot;Priory attachment&quot;; but
though its opening to the public would have been granted freely by
its owner, on condition that the London County Council and Wandsworth
authorities should make, repair, and keep in order the road,
the London County Council refused to take any part in the matter,
and so Priory Lane, &quot;with bars at each end,&quot; remains a &quot;spot
barred&quot; to the Richmond Park-loving Londoner. The cost of
making this mile and a quarter is over-estimated at £2000. But as
there are, as the <i>Daily Chronicle</i> describes it, &quot;<i>bars at each end</i>,&quot;
surely these &quot;bars,&quot; if properly licensed, would bring in a splendid
revenue from thirsty pedestrians, equestrians, and wheelers of all
sorts and conditions.</p>

<h2>THE <i>VERY</i> LATEST &quot;HITTITE&quot; SEAL!</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:60%;">
<img width="100%" src="images/166.png" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="indent">This most remarkable seal, while not, perhaps, affording a complete solution of the
&quot;Hittite&quot; problem, presents many features of the greatest possible interest. In general
form it is of the shape known to the scientific world as the <i>Kennington Oval</i>, and the fact,
in reality, affords the key to the partial decipherment of the &quot;Pictographs&quot; on the two
faces of the seal.</p>

<p class="indent">At the upper part of the first face, shown above, is a double-headed goddess, wearing a
cap with horns, which would seem to indicate that the well-known &quot;Horns&quot; at Kennington
was, in early times, a temple dedicated to the goddess who specially watched over the chances
of some ancient pastime to which these incised figures manifestly refer. Beneath this goddess
is a two-headed bird, hitherto supposed to be an eagle; but we consider that its identity
with the bird known to connoisseurs as the &quot;<i>Double-Duck</i>&quot; is now fully established.</p>

<p class="indent">Beneath this, again, is a curious dwarf figure with straddling legs, which, as occurring
elsewhere, has been described as <i>homunculus</i>. He is evidently engaged in practising the
pastime above referred to. On the right is a curious triangular object, in which we can
scarcely be wrong in seeing a primitive tent or pavilion, an adjunct of great importance to
the players in times of hunger.</p>

<p class="indent">The other face bears a spirited &quot;Pictograph&quot; of more than ordinary realism, representing,
we would suggest, the triumphal retirement of the <i>homunculus</i> at the conclusion of his
performance, and the animated figures above would seem to represent the rejoicing adherents
of the retiring player. The objects above have sorely puzzled the student, but we think it
may now be generally admitted that they depict the sun setting in splendour behind a
reservoir of some gaseous compound such as may even now be seen at Kennington.</p>

<p class="indent">It is even suggested by some that the <i>homunculus</i> may be actually a portrait of some
diminutive but distinguished Surri player of primitive times.</p>

<hr />

<h2>WELCOME HOME!</h2>

<p class="indent">It is with great satisfaction that we read,
in the columns of the <i>South Wales Daily
News</i>, of a citizens&#39; meeting in the Cardiff
Town Hall, for the purpose of discussing and
arranging plans the object of which is to give
a suitable and cordial &quot;Welcome-home Reception&quot;
to the noble owner of <i>Valkyrie III.</i>,
upon his return from the United States. That
&quot;gallant little Wales&quot; should take the initiative
in such a project is only natural,
and <span class="smcap">John Bull</span> congratulates <span class="smcap">Taffy</span>, and
sincerely hopes that his happily-proposed
demonstration to the Glamorganshire peer
will be carried out with all the success it
deserves. Lord <span class="smcap">Dunraven</span> has done much
for yachting, and his recent sportsman-like
conduct under the trying circumstances he
encountered in the &quot;trans-pond-tine drama,&quot;
<i>The America Cup</i>, fully merits recognition,
not only from Wales, but also from the rest
of the United Kingdom. Slightly parodying
<span class="smcap">Byron</span>, we might address the following:
lines to Miss <span class="smcap">Columbia</span>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Gil Blas-é.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Charles Lamb</span> declared the
human species to be divided into two distinct
races, <i>the men who borrow</i> and <i>the men who
lend</i>, of which he considered the former to be
infinitely superior to the latter, and consequently
designated them the &quot;Great Race.&quot;
Now, undoubtedly the great race in Paris at
present is the female race, the race of lady
bicyclists who, not content with borrowing
men&#39;s hearts, have appropriated the masculine
garment as well. The enterprising <i>Gil
Blas</i> newspaper recently &quot;brought off&quot; a
novelty in the way of <i>Courses à bicyclettes</i>
for opera dancers, which took place with great
<i>éclat</i> in the Bois de Boulogne. The fair
terpsichoreans, from &quot;<i>prima ballerina assoluta</i>,
who is famous from St. Petersburg to
Utah,&quot; to the humblest <i>rat</i>, or ballet-girl,
assembled in force, and, with &quot;light fantastic
toe&quot; and &quot;twinkling foot&quot; pressing
the treadles of their willing machines, keenly
contested the various events, to the huge
delight of a concourse of frivolous <i>boulevardiers</i>.
After the morning&#39;s sport the <i>chic
Bicycli-ennes</i> were entertained at an elegant
<i>déjeuner</i>, the <i>menu</i> of which, compiled by an
Anglo-Parisian <i>gourmet</i>, comprised among
its appetising items a new dish, to wit,
<i>&OElig;ufs Cocottes à &quot;l&#39; Wheel</i>.&quot;</p>

<h2>ROUNDABOUT READINGS.</h2>

<p class="indent">Relieved for a space by my own decree
from the mere labour of searching for topics
in the newspaper press of the United Kingdom,
I have been seeking recreation in the
pursuit, how often unavailing, of the partridge.
&quot;Come down on Thursday next,&quot;
wrote my friend, <span class="smcap">Hartey</span>, &quot;for four or five
days. We are going to shoot our outsides.&quot;
This was sufficiently alarming, but it was
obviously better than shooting our insides,
and accordingly on the appointed day the
county of Norfolk received me.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="indent">Would that it were sufficient on these
occasions merely to arouse the primitive
sporting instinct of man, to revert to the fringe
of barbarism and to sally out, scantily clothed,
with sling or bow or snare, in quest of game.
But alas, the curse of civilisation cannot be
got rid of; one has to think of cartridges,
cartridge-bags, caps, boots, gaiters, stockings,
and heaven knows what besides. And
in the end the odds are quite ten to one that
you forget your cartridge-magazine, or that
your beautiful new pair of patent hammerless
ejector guns get left under the seat of
the railway-carriage and become for a day or
two the sport of station-masters and porters
on the Great Eastern Railway.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="indent">&quot;Shooting the outsides&quot; is a sport by itself.
Your one desire is to keep the birds off the
land of your neighbours; the one desire of
the birds is to seek that land. Your best
covey gets up and pops comfortably into a
lovely root-field a couple of hundred yards
away, but you cannot go after it, for the field
belongs to another property, and the derisive
birds can chirp and run at their ease, while
you tramp on, shotless, under a broiling sun.
However, the outsides have to be made good,
and now and then a slice of luck rewards you.
For instance, if a neighbouring vicar has
given notice that after a certain date he means
to shoot over his own glebe, your delight is
all the keener when you all but annihilate a
large covey of birds whose home is on the
glebe.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="indent">There is much humour in dogs. Your
own retriever, whom you have broken yourself,
is of course the quietest and best-behaved
dog in the world. He also possesses
the surest nose and the softest mouth. Why,
then, does he choose a moment when everybody
is looking to run in wildly and disturb
every bird in the field? Or why, when you
have sent him in pursuit of a runner, does he
lie down and pant, while the keeper&#39;s dog,
a tangled door-mat of the poodle species,
solidly, and without ostentation, tracks down
the wounded bird, and finally deposits it at
the keeper&#39;s feet, just as you are assuring
everybody that there is not a vestige of scent,
and that no dog could possibly be expected to
work in such weather.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="indent">Then, again, I want to know this about
partridges. How is that, when they are
driven to the guns, they always select a novice
and unanimously fly over his head? There
is an unerring instinct about them. Your
novice may disguise himself in all the sport-stained
paraphernalia of a veteran shooter.
Bless his simple heart, he can&#39;t deceive the
birds. They come to him and court the death
that never comes with a heroic persistency.
When he has attained to the status of a
veteran, and the birds about him are scarcer,
he will look back with a fond regret to the
days of his bird-frequented novitiate.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="indent">The long and the short of it is that partridges
possess a cunning amounting to genius.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>
Under a soft and guileless exterior the partridge
hides a store of deceitful wiles that
might put <span class="smcap">Sherlock Holmes</span> or any of his
countless imitators to shame. His one object
is not to be killed, and this he pursues with a
ferocious pertinacity against which keepers,
beaters, dogs and guns match themselves in
vain. Here, then, is a ballad of the cunning
partridge.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The partridge is a cunning bird.</p>
<p class="i2">He likes not those who bring him down:</p>
<p>From age to age he has preferred</p>
<p class="i2">The shots who blaze into the brown,</p>
<p>Whose stocks come never shoulder-high,</p>
<p class="i2">Who never pause to pick and choose,</p>
<p>But on whose biceps you descry</p>
<p class="i2">The black, the blue, the tell-tale bruise.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Or should a stubborn cartridge swell,</p>
<p class="i2">And jam, as it may chance, your gun,</p>
<p>The sly old partridge knows it well,</p>
<p class="i2">&quot;Great Scott!&quot; he seems to chirp &quot;here&#39;s fun.&quot;</p>
<p>He gathers all his feathered tribe,</p>
<p class="i2">They leave the stubble or the grass,</p>
<p>And with one wild and whirling gibe</p>
<p class="i2">Above your silent muzzles pass.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Your scheme you carefully contrive,</p>
<p class="i2">And, while each beater waves his flag,</p>
<p>Your fancy, as they duly drive,</p>
<p class="i2">Already sees a record bag.</p>
<p>But, lo, they baulk your keen desire,</p>
<p class="i2">For, though with birds the sky grows black,</p>
<p>Not one of them will face the fire,</p>
<p class="i2">And every blessed bird goes back.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>For partridges I&#39;ll try no more;</p>
<p class="i2">Why should I waste in grim despair?</p>
<p>Take me to far Albania&#39;s shore,</p>
<p class="i2">And let me bag the woodcock there.</p>
<p>Or on the Susquehanna&#39;s stream</p>
<p class="i2">I&#39;ll shoot with every chance of luck</p>
<p>The gourmet&#39;s glory and his dream,</p>
<p class="i2">The canvas-back, that juicy duck.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Yea, any other bird I&#39;ll shoot,</p>
<p class="i2">But not again with toil and pain</p>
<p>I&#39;ll tramp the stubble or the root,</p>
<p class="i2">Nor wait behind a fence in vain.</p>
<p>For of all birds you hit or miss</p>
<p class="i2">(I&#39;ve tried it out by every test),</p>
<p>Again I say with emphasis</p>
<p class="i2">The partridge is the cunningest.</p>
</div>
</div>

<hr />

<p class="indent">So much for the partridge. Before many
weeks are over it is quite possible that I may
have to promote the pheasant to the top rank
of cunning. And this I know full well about
my friend the pheasant, that, although he is
a large bird and seems to fly slowly, he is a
very hard bird to hit, as he ought to be hit.
And most of us find it much easier to hit the
immeasurable space by which every bird on
the wing is surrounded.</p>

<h2>&quot;SIC TRANSIT GLORIA HOODI.&quot;</h2>

<p class="indent">A traditional relic of the picturesque
poacher prince of Sherwood Forest, were it
even &quot;no bigger than an agate-stone on the
forefinger of an alderman,&quot; would, we presume,
be worthy of jealous preservation. It
is, therefore, the more surprising that Yorkshiremen
have not taken adequate means for
the protection of &quot;a <i>massive</i> piece of millstone
grit which, from time immemorial, has
stood on a rising ground overlooking the Aire
Valley.&quot; Reclining in the shade of this historic
stone&mdash;named after him&mdash;&quot;bold <span class="smcap">Robin
Hood</span> would, with his Maid <span class="smcap">Marian</span>, sup
and bowse from horn and can,&quot; using it as a
kind of half-way house, so to speak, on his
journeys to York. But oh, shade of Friar
<span class="smcap">Tuck</span>, thou genial exemplar (dare we hint it?)
of what is known as the &quot;sporting&quot; parson&mdash;a
type, alas! rapidly becoming as extinct
as thyself&mdash;the Vandal hordes, in the shape
of the Bradford Corporation, have come with
their destroying trail of dynamite, and, under
base pretence of making way for a water
conduit, <i>have cloven the Robin Hood stone
into four parts!</i> Not until the blasting
powder was in position did the people realise
the full horror of the dread deed about to
be wrought; and then, to save that which
once sheltered an outlaw, they sent for a
policeman, who, of course, arrived &quot;after
the blast was over.&quot; &quot;The occurrence has
caused a feeling of indignation throughout the
district,&quot; says the <i>Yorkshire Post</i>, adding,
&quot;and it is unlikely that the incident will be
passed over in silence.&quot; It certainly was not
accomplished &quot;in silence&quot;! Yorkers! why
did you not shut the stable door <i>before</i> the

<p class="indent">And the melodrama,&mdash;showing how a match was broken off at a Polo
gathering, and how many times in one evening Mr. <span class="smcap">Henry Neville</span>
can take off his hat in a wonderful variety of courteous ways, and
how he gets taken off himself by a Matabelian shot; showing, too, how
funny Mr. <span class="smcap">Giddens</span> and Mr. <span class="smcap">Lionel Rignold</span> can be, and how admirably
Miss <span class="smcap">Fanny Brough</span> behaves as an eccentric lady of fashion
in exceptionally trying circumstances; how good as a villain <span class="smcap">Charles
Dalton</span> is; how strikingly <span class="smcap">Druriolanus</span> has managed stage effects,
and how admirably his auxiliaries have done their work,&mdash;the melodrama,
containing all this and very much more, achieves a distinct
success.</p>

yet sing about them triumphantly to the tune of &quot;<i>Lillie-bulero</i>,&quot; or
any other that takes her fancy if she objects to the original air as being
out of date. Why not a new version of &quot;<i>Ti-a-ra Boom-de-ay</i>&quot;?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">An Intolerable Nuisance.</span>&quot;&mdash;The <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> is to be
felicitated upon a praiseworthy but, unfortunately, unsuccessful
attempt to institute a campaign against the organ fiends haunting our
streets. But the letters which, under the heading &quot;An Intolerable
Nuisance,&quot; poured in briskly at first, have finally &quot;ceased and determined.&quot;
We have been told of a village, &quot;in the Ausonian hills,&quot;
peopled by retired organ-grinders who, having amassed a fortune&mdash;resulting
from bribes, given by the despairing citizen, as an inducement
to the torturer to remove himself &quot;to the next street&quot;&mdash;repair
thither to enjoy an <i>otium cum dignitate</i>, untroubled by any qualm of
conscience for the suffering inflicted by them upon patient Britons.
Will some <i>Novum Organon</i> tell us the whereabouts of this Utopia,
and let us thither banish in shiploads these &quot;intolerable nuisances.&quot;</p>

<h2>CABBY; OR, REMINISCENCES OF THE RANK AND THE ROAD.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>The Mistery of a Hansom Cab?</i> Oh yes, <i>I</i>&#39;ve read it; or leastways dipped into it.</p>
<p>Rayther perlice-newsy sort of a story; strong flaviour of murder and unsweetened gin to it.</p>
<p>&quot;Less cab than <i>license</i>,&quot; young <span class="smcap">Mulberry</span> sniggers. Young <span class="smcap">Mulberry</span> fancies &#39;imself as a joker.</p>
<p>Still, we do &#39;ave some rum finds in our cabs, from a set o&#39; false teeth to a red-ended poker.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Give me a shiver the latter thing did, I &#39;ad just dropped one fare and &#39;ad took up a foller.</p>
<p>First was a gloomyish kind of a cove with a oystery heye and cheeks saller and oller;</p>
<p>Second as smart a young minx as you&#39;d meet. I &#39;ad &#39;ardly whipped up when I &#39;eard such a squeaking,</p>
<p>And sharp through the trap shoved a scarlet-hued <i>summat</i>. It give me a turn, in a manner o&#39; speaking.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Parties are wonderful partial to prodding with brolly or walking-stick, ah yes, <i>and</i> rifles.</p>
<p>Fares when they want you to pull up &#39;ave got little thought for your eyes and they don&#39;t stick at trifles.</p>
<p>But this was a rayther unusual prodder! &quot;&#39;Old &#39;ard, Miss,&quot; I says. &quot;Wot&#39;s this &#39;ere little caper?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Cabby!&quot; she squeals, &quot;put me down! It&#39;s a &#39;orror&mdash;I found in the corner &#39;ere&mdash;wropped in brown paper!&quot;</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Out she would git; when, a puffin&#39; and wheezin&#39;, up came the old buffer who&#39;d left it behind &#39;im.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s <i>mine!</i>&quot; &#39;e gulps, and &#39;e grabs it like winking. &quot;Ah, my poor <span class="smcap">Joey</span>! I wish I could find <i>&#39;im</i></p>
<p>One &#39;arf as easy. The cleverest clown, Miss, in England; and this was &#39;is favrit hot poker.</p>
<p>All &#39;e &#39;as left to remember &#39;im by!&quot;&mdash;an&#39; &#39;e &#39;ugged it. I pitied the saller old joker.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>But Miss, she turned rusty, and cut up &#39;er didos. &quot;You ought to know better,&quot; she sniffed. &quot;It&#39;s just ojus</p>
<p>To leave &#39;orrid objecks like that in a cab; though I own it&#39;s well fitted, and &#39;ighly commojus;</p>
<p>But lor&#39;, <i>&#39;ow</i> it scared me!&quot; &quot;Well, lydy,&quot; I says, being roughed up a bit by &#39;er stuckuppy manner,</p>
<p>&quot;It wouldn&#39;t &#39;a&#39; bit you, or burnt you, if you &#39;adn&#39;t <i>opened</i> it, I&#39;ll bet a quid to a tanner.&quot;</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Whereon she flounced off without paying no fare. &quot;Humph!&quot; snorts the old gent, and forks over a shilling.</p>
<p>Talk about &#39;onesty! Give the respectables charnce of a <i>safe</i> bite, and ain&#39;t they just willing?</p>
<p>&#39;Onesty&#39;s scarcer than millions, I reckon. You just leave a purse or a pencil-case &#39;andy</p>
<p>For fares to lay &#39;old on, and see if there&#39;s much of a choice &#39;twixt poor Cabby and polished-up dandy.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>But t&#39;other evening, a &#39;igh-nosed old dowager tipped me bare fare, and away she was sailing</p>
<p>When I twigged a smart seal-skin bag in &#39;er &#39;and as I <i>knew</i> my last fare&mdash;who seemed toddly and ailing&mdash;</p>
<p>Had carried before, and it chinked as she shook. &quot;Excuse <i>me</i>,&quot; I says, &quot;but that bag, mum&mdash;I&#39;ll trouble you!&quot;</p>
<p>Lord, if you&#39;d seen &#39;er flush up and go fluttery! &#39;Taint only snobs as&#39;ll dodge you and double you.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Nobs very often are spry on the nick. Klepto-something or other they call it in <i>their</i> case.</p>
<p>Old <span class="smcap">Billy Boger</span> &#39;as told me that once &#39;e was landing a &#39;eavyish trunk up a staircase,</p>
<p>And &#39;eard the young lady fare whisper &#39;er Ma, &quot;Oh, <i>see</i> wot I&#39;ve found in the cab!&quot;&mdash;&quot;<i>&#39;Ush</i>, my darling!&quot;</p>
<p>The old dutch garsps out. And old <span class="smcap">Bill</span> did&#39;nt get it&mdash;the bracelet&mdash; without lots o&#39; sniffing and snarling.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Yah! They are dreadfully down on poor Cabbies who don&#39;t toe the mark in the matter o&#39; pickings,</p>
<p>But what with the Burlington bilks, and the toffs as you can&#39;t trust too fur when there&#39;s prospeck of nickings,</p>
<p>And all the mean fakes that a cabby is fly to, in fares who&#39;re well-off and did ought to know better,</p>
<p>The rank doesn&#39;t think much of hupper-class &#39;onesty, give you <i>my</i> word. Now I&#39;m off for a wetter!</p>
